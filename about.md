<p>Hi, I’m Ahmed. I work with data to help people make smarter decisions.<br><br>

Over the past few years, I’ve worked in different industries: telecom, tech, and music. I’ve analyzed data, built dashboards, and managed projects that bring structure to messy problems. I use tools like Python, SQL, R, and Power BI, but what really matters to me is the story the data tells and the actions it enables. I’ve led cross-functional projects, delivered reports used by business leaders, and built visualizations that cut through the noise. I like figuring out how systems work, spotting patterns, and creating tools that save people time or give them clarity.<br><br>

Outside of work, I spend time learning, building small tools, following interesting conversations around tech, data, and strategy, and whenever I can, scuba diving.</p></div></section>
